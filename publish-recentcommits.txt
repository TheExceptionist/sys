571fa5e Like earlier, jor1k expects an element id to write vm stats to, so we use that instead of using SysViewModel - now we don't need a custom copy of jor1k-master anymore. The vm-stats span changes often in width due to varying speeds of the VM, so made the span a fixed-width inline block element. No need for separate jor1k build block as there is only one file - which is now included in the main js build block.
4a97402 Remove jor1k_hd_images as they are no longer needed. They have been moved to sysassets for reference/archival purposes.
