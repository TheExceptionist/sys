42ac97a Fix grunt test phantom js timeout: mocha version 2.2.x does not work with current testing setup, probably because of grunt-mocha. I have tried debugging, the issue does not seem to be any configuration or code we have written. grunt-mocha's latest supported version of mocha is 1.21.5, so we should ideally be using that version. But 2.1.0 works, so using that.
